        <p>Thanks for your interest in using this app to help you create new passwords. Before we start up the app, there are just a few legal things we need to cover:</p>

              <span class="tagline">Passwords created by this app are psuedo-random in nature.</span>
              Although we know *how* the app tries to make passwords, we can't be for sure *what* it will generate. While we will strive to prevent offensive content from being created, we can't be certain these may not inadvertantly appear.

          <li>
            <span>
              <span class="tagline">Passwords created are only as strong as you make them.</span>
              While this app does try create strong psuedo-random passwords, it does so based on the parameters you specify within the app settings. To ensure the strongest possible passwords, always use the longest password length possible and include as many different types of characters/words as permitted.

              <span class="tagline">For security reasons, this app does not save any passwords that are generated or keep a history of previously generated passwords.</span>
              You will need to be responsible for saving any passwords created by this app for your personal use.

              This app does not collect usage data, sometimes called telemetry data, by default.  Any usage data that may be collected will done so on an Opt-In basis.
